Raw Project Description:

You will now take the foundation you created in Project 4 (Amusement Park Generator (I)) and add the User Interface for the app, along with a short list of new features and entrant types handling. You might need to refactor some code in order to accommodate these changes.

Upon completion, you will have a functional iPad app, created entirely yourself! The app can take user input and create personalized entrant passes for all the entrant types. When the passes are being swiped at different locations in the park, business rules such as whether the entrant is allowed to access an area, whether the entrant can get a discount, will be tested.




Extra Credits:

Add additional input validation to ensure that phone numbers and zip codes are all numerical, birthday is of the correct format (MM/DD/YYYY) and that all text entries are of “reasonable” length. You can decide what you deem reasonable, and put it in the relevant comment in the code. You will only be graded on the implementation. An alert needs to be generated to notify the user that there is an invalid input. As you might have noticed, we are adding some flexibility to the projects as the course progress, so that you can be more creative. Please do make sure you put in clear related comments to communicate to the reviewer.


Add a feature to the swipe method(s), so that a “ding” sound is played when an entrant is granted access and a “buzz” sound is played when an entrant is denied access.
